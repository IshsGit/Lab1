### Lab1

This is a web scraping projecting to extract data from WHO's website. The purpose is to develop a search filter index in reference to the Country and Value results. The next major step of the project is to translate the raw filtered data into postgres to gain the ability to query the data. The next step is to connect to a server, receive a live feed to provide automated updates towards our existing data and allow expanding our queries.
